# Example Stories and Tests

## Storybook: component rendering

Files that end in `*.stories.tsx` are rendered by storybook.

Storybook can be used to check component rendering, with styles and locales.

## Jest: component testing

Files that end in `*.test.tsx` are included in Jest testing (run with `yarn test`).

Jest can be used to ensure content (ie. language definiton) and accessiblity requirements are met.
